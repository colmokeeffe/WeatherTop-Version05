This is my final semester 1 joint assignment of Programming and Web Development, HDip Computer Science WIT .

All features bar trending have been completed as per specification brief.

The dynamic web app WeatherTop is deployed using Heroku (connected to Github-git pushed by Sourcetree) and the database is stored on the cloud with ElephantSQL.
The site front end is designed using the Semantic UI framework, and back end in Java, constructed using the Play web app framework and on IntelliJ Idea.


On launching WeatherTop, you have the option of logging in if you are already registered or signing up as a new member.
When you register your details are stored in the Elephant database. Homer Simpson is a recognised member, his details are seeded from YAML file.

Once logged in, you are directed to a dashboard page. Here you have the option of adding or deleting stations, if stations already exist.
Simply enter station name and its coordinates, the stations are listed alphabetically.

The stations can be opened up in station view, where a card summary of the station readings are displayed.
All the latest readings required as per Release 3 in the brief are contained in the card, and the various conversions. The trending spec is absent.

A table contains all the readings entered for the members station. Here you have the option to delete a readings report.
The card will update automatically.

The navigation menu gives you the option to be directed to the about stage which provides more information on WeatherTop.
The last option on the menu, is a dropdown that enables the user to logout of the session or edit their user details provided on registration or seeded from YAML
If the user edits their details, their user account will be updated an they will be redirected back to the dashboard view.

If logout is selected, they will be directed to the startpage.

The site theme/style is predominately black and white with colour designated for the buttons, logo and banner created.
